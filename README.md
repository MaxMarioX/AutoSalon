A student project aimed at developing a program for car rental companies. The application has the following range of possibilities:

- Logging in to verify the user in terms of his permissions;
- Managing customers, employees and cars in the companyâ€™s offer;
- Car booking and control of current bookings;
- Printing invoices and presenting statistics.

The project required the development of a conceptual data model using entity relationship modeling and the transformation of the conceptual data model into a relational schema using normalization principles. Based on the relational model, the SQL code implementing the model in the database was developed. The graphical interface of the application was developed using the Visual Studio development environment with the use of the C ++ language.
